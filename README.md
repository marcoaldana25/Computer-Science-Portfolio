### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Software can be determined as functional by the incorporation of unit tests. That is, tests designed to test code functionality as well as verify expected results. Adding a solid layer of code coverage can ensure that an application will behave as expected and produce the correct results. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs can be captured and transformed into project or application requirements. These requirements should be broken into small chunks of work which are often called 'deliverables'. It is essential to have deliverables align with all of the user requirements to ensure the end product meets the consumer's expectation.

### How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I like to gain as much of an understanding of the entire process as possible at the time. Having a view of the big picture allows for a variety of circumstances to be accounted for. It is important to capture all requirements when designing a new application, but it is also important to make sure that proper design decisions are taken into consideration to have the software be efficient.
